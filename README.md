# Preventing and Predicting UPI Fraud: A Big Data and ML Approach

A machine learning and big data framework for real-time UPI fraud detection and prevention.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project presents a machine learning and big dataâ€“driven framework to detect and prevent fraudulent activities in Unified Payments Interface (UPI) transactions.  

By combining **NLP-based text analysis**, **anomaly detection**, **behavioural profiling**, and **real-time stream processing** (Apache Kafka & Spark Streaming), the system enhances fraud detection accuracy and response time.  

The hybrid approach achieves an **F1-score of 0.92** and **AUC of 0.95**, effectively minimizing financial risks and improving trust in digital payment ecosystems.

## ðŸš€ Key Highlights
- Integration of structured (transactional) & unstructured (text) data  
- NLP techniques (TF-IDF, embeddings, sentiment analysis) for fraud detection  
- Advanced anomaly detection (Isolation Forest, Autoencoders, One-Class SVM)  
- Behavioural analysis with HMMs and RNNs  
- Real-time fraud detection with streaming analytics  
- Effective handling of imbalanced datasets (SMOTE, cost-sensitive learning)
